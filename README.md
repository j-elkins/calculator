Calculator

Built in November 2021 as the final assignment for The Odin Project Foundations course.

The assignment was to create a calculator with basic functions (+, -, \*, /) using HTML and JavaScript.
The most challenginog part was thinking through when & where to store the input from each buttn, and calling the correct calculation functions using that input.

Summary of what I learned:

- Parameters, variables, & scope
- Accessing & storing data from button input
- DOM Manipulation

In total this project took me 9 hours to complete. The bonus challenges took another 5 hours to complete.

BONUS challenges:

- add decimal point
- add backspace button to delete one character at a time
- add keyboard functionality
